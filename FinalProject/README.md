## Final Independent Project
This repository includes all files pertaining to my final independent investigation. 

The _Mosites_Microbiome_Sharing_ files are the csv data files and the Excel variable explanation file that were obtained from the [Dryad repository for Mosites et al](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.f7tp6) _"Microbiome sharing between children, livestock and household surfaces in western Kenya"_.

All of the code that I used for this project can be found in the scripts [cleaning_script.sh](https://github.com/msbrasher/CompBioLabsHw/blob/main/FinalProject/cleaning_script.sh) (shell pipeline) and [animal_interactions.R](https://github.com/msbrasher/CompBioLabsHw/blob/main/FinalProject/animal_interactions.R) (R analysis). 

The final products include the final image files, [FinalFilteredPlots.png](https://github.com/msbrasher/CompBioLabsHw/blob/main/FinalProject/FinalFilteredPlots.png) and [FinalUnfilteredPlots.png](https://github.com/msbrasher/CompBioLabsHw/blob/main/FinalProject/FinalUnfilteredPlots.png), and the [final project write up]().
